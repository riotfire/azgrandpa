    <h1>Tribute to my AZ Grandpa</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Dustin and I am Joe's eldest grandson, his mother's first great-grandson, and my mother's first child.</p>
    
    <p>As the oldest, and obviously better-looking of the grandsons, I’d like to talk about me for a second. While I currently live in New York City, I was born and raised here in Phoenix, where much of my personality and many passions formed.</p>
    
    <p>One of my favorite things to do in New York is to go to Madison Square Garden to watch the Knicks play basketball. They are one of my favorite teams until the Phoenix Suns come to town. I was first introduced to the Suns in 1992. I was about 9 years old, and Grandpa took me to a preseason game. The cost of entry? A can of baked beans. This food-drive/exhibition game changed my life. I was obsessed. Everything in my life became about basketball and the Suns.</p>
    
    <p>School art projects had the Suns logo screaming across them. My weekends and summers were spent shooting hoops in the front yard where my father installed a basketball hoop. My clothes were always matching purple and orange, and much to my mother’s dismay, I wouldn’t let her wash my favorite Suns hat that I wore every day in the hot Phoenix sun, for years. That thing was, I think my mom said, “disgusting.”</p>
    
    <h2>Adventure with Grandpa</h2>
    
    <p>Beyond basketball, my grandfather helped instill a sense of adventure. As everyone knows, Grandpa loved the outdoors. Throughout the years growing up, Grandpa would often appear unannounced, asking my mother, “Can Dusty come out and play?”</p>
    
    <p>We would often drive to different parts of Arizona to explore. It could be an old turquoise mine or Chocolate Falls, but it was never just a hike through the forest. One such adventure had us up north, east of Flagstaff, with a friend of his. Each of us was holding metal detectors. We were searching for something worth more than gold: meteorite. Yes, we were hunting a crashed meteor that was reported in a Flagstaff newspaper in the late 1800s.</p>
    
    <p>Later that day, we went to an actual meteor site, the massive Meteor Crater east of Flagstaff. We ended the day fishing after dark in St. John’s Lake, near the New Mexico border. It was around this time an angry Grandma had gotten in contact with us to ask where the heck we were. An early morning hike accidentally turned into an overnight adventure.</p>
    
    <p>After his classic short laugh and mischievous smile, Grandpa decided it was time to come home.</p>
    
    <h2>Love for Technology</h2>
    
    <p>One of my strongest interests is my love for technology and computers. I have loved computers since I was a child when I was introduced to an early ‘80s gem known as the Commodore 64. My grandfather taught me how to use this powerful machine. Computers back then were much different—no mouse, no Windows, no storage. To load a program, you put a 5-inch floppy disk into a drive and typed a small piece of computer code to run the application. My grandfather taught me how to do all of this.</p>
    
    <p>He was such a good teacher that while in kindergarten, a teacher was trying to show us a program on a Commodore 64. She couldn’t remember how to get the system to work. So I stepped in and helped. While kids using technology is common today, back in 1989, it was rare for anyone, let alone a small child, to know anything.</p>
    
    <p>While I mostly played games in those early days—my favorite, of course, being <em>Ghostbusters</em>—Grandpa also showed me a program used to make music. You could load some scores, my favorite being Pachelbel’s <em>Canon in D</em>, and then modify them or write music from scratch. I loved this program and credit it for my interest in music and my short stint as a music instructor.</p>
    
    <p>Computers didn’t end at software. Together, Grandpa taught me how to build computers, how to assemble the parts inside the machine, and what each piece does. He explained how the electronics work—capacitors, jumper pins, and when to avoid messing with the power supply. That was a fairly loose and fast rule—mostly trial and error. Some shocking lessons were learned. But I also learned logic, attention to detail, and critical thinking.</p>
    
    <h2>The Internet and Beyond</h2>
    
    <p>Grandpa saw the power of the internet in the mid-‘90s—before the media even began calling it a fad. HTML, the core markup language used to create and structure web pages, was invented in 1990 but really changed with HTML version 2.0 in 1995. This key change laid the foundation of the internet we know today. That same year, Grandpa taught me how to build my first website.</p>
    
    <p>In 1995, at 11 years old, with a bit of guidance, I published my first website on the World Wide Web using a popular free service, GeoCities (RIP). My controversial website was called <strong>“Things That Don’t Suck.”</strong></p>
    
    <p>Today, I’m the head of product marketing at SQUIRE, a $750 million company that uses web technology to help 20 million people find, schedule, and pay for services of over 32,000 barbers that use our system around the world.</p>
    
    <h2>A Lasting Legacy</h2>
    
    <p>No matter what I’ve achieved, I will always be that little boy, sitting in the hard wooden chair on Acoma Dr., toying with a Commodore 64, shaped by the great man we celebrate today.</p>
    
    <p>Grandpa taught me to love the Suns, to explore the world, and to build something bigger than myself. But more than anything, he taught me how to be curious, kind, and a little mischievous.</p>

    <h2>I love you, Grandpa.</h2>
